# Assignment operators

An assignment operator assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand.The values an operator works on are called operands. Let's look at an example.

```javascript
/* 
    x       =       14
    operand operator operand
*/

x = 14;
```

The assignment operator `=` , assigns the value of the right operand to its left operand.
